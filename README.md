# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Chaoyu Sun

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
2 or 3 days? I am not sure, but does not spend many time to do.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Color I guess? The color of button, yes, the red button. Because when I do the kivy practical, I don't know how to change colors, I tried RGBA, tried color code and whatever it just doesn't work, untill I know it works by float number... so, I REMENBERED THE FLOAT NUMBER!!!!! And I used it to my button color, fair enough, right?

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Actually a lot. I don't think this is a program, it just more like a smaill coding toy, and...I think there are some code redundancy? I don't want to do agile development and fix it, lazy...

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Every thing is good, front-stage is well, and back-stage is well. and still used MVC module.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
For this question, I think there might be had some problem, this project be divided part 1 and part 2, when I am done part 1, and I see part 2, it will create some redundancy code, so if I do project like this again, I need to know the whole demand before I start to code. 

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
So, all the code resources are learned right? The new things for me, I think is the kivy code, front-stage code. And basically used MVC to use them(the PlaceCollection class is given so I think it is a part of demand for the assignment?).

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
There are 2 questions obstacled me like total 1 hour. first is when I created a dynamic button, I don't know how to get value when I click it, of course I overcame it by check practical 7's cdoe =a=. and another one is how to save the data into file. I see the assignment sheet shows the function is in Lecture slices, yes find it, on_stop, so that's it.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
I learned java first, than familar with C, Go, the python is 4th language I learned I guess? for classes...ok, help coding, help for maintenance or something. Actually when people write a smaill toy, Process-oriented is more simple, but when people want a actually project, if use Process-oriented, the biggest problem is code redundancy, so...I don't know, I used Object-oriented at the very beginning, java connot do Process-oriented hhhhhhhhh.
